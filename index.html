<h3> Introduction </h3>
<p>We used the Poker Hands dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository in a distributed environment to
build a multi-class classifier using the Naive-Bayes classification algorithm and implement AdaBoost technique
(forming k such classifiers with each subsequent classifier learning from the mistakes of its previous one) to
improve its accuracy. Then, each of the classifiers formed are used to predict the outcome/label of other incoming
poker hands and their predictions are voted with a score and the prediction with a maximum score is considered to be
the final prediction.</p>

11. CLASS "Poker Hand"
Ordinal (0-9)
0: Nothing in hand; not a recognized poker hand
1: One pair; one pair of equal ranks within five cards
2: Two pairs; two pairs of equal ranks within five cards
3: Three of a kind; three equal ranks within five cards
4: Straight; five cards, sequentially ranked with no gaps
5: Flush; five cards with the same suit
6: Full house; pair + different rank three of a kind
7: Four of a kind; four equal ranks within five cards
8: Straight flush; straight + flush
9: Royal flush; {Ace, King, Queen, Jack, Ten} + flush
Context/ Motivation for the idea:
Playing a game of Poker is exciting. Once you get to know the poker rules, you are good to go. Why
not design ourselves that game? Coding a poker game is pretty simple once you know the poker rules of the game and code
it accordingly. But, is it possible to design such a game without knowing such rules? The Machine Learning concept
enables us to do the same. Machine learning involves the study and implementation of algorithms with the needed
data in-hand. Such algorithms build a model from example inputs (input dataset) in order to make data-driven decisions
to solve a problem instead of following strict program instructions.
Again, a lot of machine learning algorithms are available. But, traditionally these algorithms are implemented based
on a sequential approach. Given a large dataset, it makes sense to parallelize the data and process it in a distributed
environment. The Map-Reduce paradigm allows us to do it. Certain common machine learning algorithms fit the Statistical
Query Model, allowing us to write them in “summation forms” which makes them possible to be implemented using MapReduce
paradigm. Thus, coding a Machine Learning algorithm using Hadoop paves way to learn both the concepts in-depth.

Algorithms to be used:
Naïve-Bayes classification algorithm
AdaBoost Technique
Platform:
Hadoop MapReduce
Tasks:
● As the Dataset is already identified, its attributes need to be understood to distinguish the data & class
attributes to be used in the implementation.
● The Naïve-Bayes multi-class classification algorithm is chosen.
● The chosen classification algorithm is to be represented in a “summation form”.
● Initial weights are assigned to each of the 25,010 records of training data.
● Then, the 25,010 records of training data (along with weights assigned to each) is sampled and distributed
using the MapReduce paradigm.
● The Mappers (no. of Mappers is based on split) perform the given summation/computations on their corresponding
data splits (partial training data) and send them to the reducer.
● The reducer combines these partial summations to obtain the final prediction model.
● This model is used on same dataset to perform predictions.
● Based on these predictions, the error of the classifier is calculated and their weights are updated accordingly.
● Then, the dataset, along with these new updated weights is sent to step 5 and the process goes on, until the error
is reduced considerably.
● Then, these classifier models developed is used on the 1,000,000 records of test data to perform predictions and to
quantify the performance of the system by calculating precision & recall.
● The prediction of the class of the hand can be used to determine the winner of a game
Division of Responsibilities:
Since our projects contains learning of the classification algorithms, mapping them to a “summation form” and MapReduce
concepts and implementing them, all the three of us will be equally participating in each of the tasks defined.
Final Product:
Definitely Accomplish:
Given one or more input poker hand/s, our product will define the label for each of the input hands (Ex: Royal Flush,
Two-of-a-kind etc.) using the classifier models developed with the input training dataset.
Like to accomplish:
Determine the winner for the inputted test poker hands.
Ideally like to accomplish:
A complete simulation of the Poker game with a set of players, bets and winner.
